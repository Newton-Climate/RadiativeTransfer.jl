    "# Automatic Differentiation in RadiativeTransfer.jl\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will demonstrate the automatic differentiation (autodiff) features in the RadiativeTransfer.jl package. Autodiff features are enabled in both the Absorption and Scattering modules' calculations. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you would like to directly see how to perform AD in RadiativeTransfer.jl functions, skip ahead to the [examples section](#Examples). But first, let's see how autodifferentiation actually _works_. \n",

    "## What is Automatic Differentiation?\n",
    "\n",
    "Automatic Differentiation is a set of techniques used to compute the derivative of numeric functions written as computer code. Autodiff is distinct from other well-known derivative-finding techniques such as: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Symbolic differentiation, in which an input formula is algebraically manipulated using differentiation rules to generate the derivative formula. \n",
    "- Numerical differentiation (method of finite differences), in which the derivative is estimated by taking the slope between the target point $(x, f(x))$ and a nearby point, $(x+\\epsilon, f(x + \\epsilon))$\n",
    "\n",
    "Automatic differentiation uses dual numbers to calculate function outputs and their derivatives. The following demonstration is borrowed from a Julia AD tutorial found [here](https://github.com/JuliaAcademy/JuliaTutorials/blob/master/introductory-tutorials/intro-to-julia/AutoDiff.ipynb). \n",
    "\n",
    "To motivate the problem, let's start with an example function: the Babylonian sqrt function, which simply computes sqrt(x). The algorithm is simple: \n",
    "\n",
    "> Repeat $t\\leftarrow(t+x/t)/ 2$ until $t$ converges to $\\sqrt{x}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each iteration has one addition and two division operations. In julia, the function looks like:\n",
